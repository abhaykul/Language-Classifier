# Language Classifier

---

## Train the model:

Training: The data file on which the model gets trained
Output: The name of the file that will contain the trained model as a pickle object.
Type: Type of model training; For decision trees put "dt"; For ada-boosted stumps put "ada"
Testing: The file on which the model is tested for parameter tuning/best tree depth
    
    python3 train.py <Training> <Output> <Type> <Testing>
    
## Test the model:

Model: filename of the model generated by train.py
Data: The datafile for predicting the classifications

    python3 predict.py <Model> <Data>

### Features Selected:

I have selected all the features based on the most recurring words present in that language. I tried using average length of words, grammar, sentence construction, alphabets used, and frequency of alphabets.

All these features failed to provide accurate classifications.

<e.g.> For frequency of alphabets, in Dutch: E, N, A are most frequently used alphabets; whereas for English it is E, T, A. This was a poor differentiator.

For average word length, both
languages have a similar curve. Spike
up between 3-4. This too, was a poor
differentiator.
